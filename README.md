# ocaml-vcard

This is a simple library for parsing the vCard file format (As defined
in RFC6350). It aims to be flexible enough to handle most common
vCards formats (letâ€™s say, 3.0 and 4.0).

It is implemented with standard OCaml lexing/parsing tools, ocamllex
and menhir.

## Dependencies

* ulex
* menhir

## Building

Type `make`. It will produce a `main.native` executable.

## Usage

`main.native` parse a file containing one or several vcard(s), and
print them on the standard output after parsing.
